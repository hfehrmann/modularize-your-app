# Modularize your App

This repository contains an example XCode project for a modularized app where each module is represented by a subproject inside a workspace.

## Requirements

- XCode 10.1
- Swift 4.2
- iOS 12.0
- Cocoapods 1.7.1

## Install

The app should compile straightforwardly because the pods are tracked by the repo. You should open `Modularizing.xcworkspace`
